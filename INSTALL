Installation Instructions
*************************

ROXTerm now uses a new bespoke build system called maitch, aimed at reducing the
time spent bootstrapping and running the configure script etc. autoconf is no
longer supported.

Requirements
************

The maitch build system requires python and the lockfile module
(python-lockfile), libtool, pkg-config and install. ROXTerm additionally needs
xsltproc + docbook-xsl, and everything else required to compile an application
linked with vte. If building from a git checkout instead of a release tarball
which incudes the pixmaps derived from the SVG file, image-magick with SVG
support (eg the librsvg2-bin package in Debian and derivatives) is also needed.

Using maitch
************

maitch is invoked via a script, usually called mscript.py. Its first argument
specifies which mode of operation to use. In normal use you will use configure,
build and then install which are analogous to ./configure, make and
make install. For more details run "./mscript.py help" or
"python mscript.py help".
