   if you were using an older version.

   keyboard shortcuts, but not yet tooltips (tomorrow)

2005-06-05

 * Added functional background tab to profile editor.

 * Can't be bothered to maintain a fully detailed changelog any more.  Nobody
   could possibly be that interested, and if they were they could use CVS
   anyway. This will probably have a knock-on effect on NEWS and make it
   confined to full releases and stuff not directly related to code changes.
