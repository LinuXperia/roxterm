ROXTerm
=======

After a long break (literally) ROXTerm is making a comeback on
[github](https://github.com/realh/roxterm). Its original home was on
[Sourceforge](https://roxterm.sourceforge.net).

The upcoming release is focused on clearing the backlog of bugs and removing
X11-specific code for improved Wayland support.
